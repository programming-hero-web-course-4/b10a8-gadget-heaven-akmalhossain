# React concepts used in this project

### React Hooks
React Hooks are functions that let you use React features (like state and lifecycle methods) in functional components. Before hooks, only class components could use features like state and lifecycle methods, but with hooks, functional components can be just as powerful.

### React routes
React Router is a library for managing navigation and routing in React applications. It enables you to create and control different routes (URLs) within your single-page application (SPA), allowing users to move between views or pages without requiring a full page reload.

### Nested routes
In React Router, nested routes allow you to create layouts with multiple levels of routing. This means you can define routes inside other routes, creating a hierarchical navigation structure within your app.

### React Toast

React Hot Toast is a popular and lightweight library for displaying toast notifications in React applications. It offers a simple API and customizable options for creating notifications for various events like success, error, and information messages.

### Handling and managing

To handle and manage data effectively in my project, I've implemented local storage. This approach ensures that data persists even when the page is refreshed or the browser is closed, making it particularly useful for storing user-specific information, like cart items or preferences. Local storage enables me to maintain state across sessions without needing a backend for simple data persistence.
